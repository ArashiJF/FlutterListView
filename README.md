## List plus tabs

This example is to test how the widgets work in flutter. Because everything is a widget, 
in a sense, you can make the widgets be the children of almost anything, in this case,
besides the basic tabs with icons and text, this tested if it was possible to add in said
tab a simple list with images, or a more hefty list. 

In the lib directory there is a README with more information
